# Clustering-Countries-for-Strategic-Aid-Allocation

**Problem statement:**
HELP International is an international humanitarian NGO that is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities.

HELP International have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. So, CEO has to make decision to choose the countries that are in the direst need of aid. Hence, your Job as a Data scientist is to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. Then you need to suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most.

**Need and Use of Solving the Problem Statement**

**Need**
*Strategic Resource Allocation:*
HELP International aims to maximize the impact of its $10 million funds by strategically allocating aid to countries most in need. Determining which countries require assistance the most is crucial for optimizing the utilization of resources and effectively combating poverty.

*Data-Driven Decision Making:*
Traditional methods of aid allocation may lack precision and objectivity. Leveraging data science techniques allows for a more systematic and evidence-based approach to identifying countries in dire need, ensuring that resources are allocated where they can make the most significant impact.

*Targeted Intervention:*
By categorizing countries based on socio-economic and health factors, HELP International can tailor interventions to address specific challenges faced by different regions. This targeted approach enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of aid delivery, leading to better outcomes for the communities served.

**Use**
*Country Categorization:*
Utilizing socio-economic and health factors, data scientists will categorize countries into distinct groups based on their level of development and need for aid. This segmentation enables HELP International to prioritize assistance to countries facing the most severe challenges.

*Strategic Decision Support:*
The data-driven insights provided by the analysis will inform the CEO's decision-making process regarding aid allocation. By highlighting countries with the greatest need, data science empowers HELP International to make informed, strategic decisions that maximize the impact of available resources.

*Resource Optimization:*
By focusing aid efforts on countries identified as being in the direst need, HELP International can optimize the allocation of its $10 million funds. This ensures that resources are directed where they can have the most significant positive impact on poverty alleviation and community development.
